# Dependency Security Scanning and Remediation Policy

## Overview

This document outlines the security scanning workflow and remediation process for dependencies in the Stellabill Backend project.

## Scanning Tools

| Tool | Purpose | Frequency |
|------|---------|-----------|
| govulncheck | Go vulnerability scanning | Weekly (schedule) + manual trigger |
| Trivy | Container/filesystem vulnerability scanning | Weekly |
| go-audit | Go dependency audit | Weekly |
| license-checker | License compliance | On push to main |

## Severity Levels

- **Critical**: RCE, remote code execution vulnerabilities
- **High**: Privilege escalation, data exfiltration
- **Medium**: DoS, information disclosure
- **Low**: Minor security concerns

## Remediation Policy

### Critical Vulnerabilities

1. **Response time**: 24 hours
2. **Action**: Upgrade to patched version or find alternative
3. **Escalation**: Notify security team immediately

### High Vulnerabilities

1. **Response time**: 7 days
2. **Action**: Plan upgrade in next sprint
3. **Workaround**: Document temporary mitigations

### Medium Vulnerabilities

1. **Response time**: 30 days
2. **Action**: Schedule upgrade in backlog

### Low Vulnerabilities

1. **Response time**: Next routine update
2. **Action**: Track and address during regular maintenance
