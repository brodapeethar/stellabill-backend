# Test Execution Guide - Health Check Implementation

## Quick Start

```bash
# Run all handler tests
go test ./internal/handlers/... -v -cover

# Run only health tests
go test ./internal/handlers/ -v -run TestHealth -cover

# Run health tests with detailed output
go test ./internal/handlers/ -v -run Test -cover -timeout 30s
```

## Test Coverage Summary

This implementation includes **16 comprehensive test cases** covering:

### Probe Tests (3 tests)
1. **TestLivenessProbe** - Verifies liveness always returns 200/healthy
2. **TestReadinessProbeHealthy** - Verifies readiness returns 200 when all dependencies healthy
3. **TestReadinessProbeDegraded** - Verifies readiness returns 503 when dependencies degraded
4. **TestHealthDetails** - Verifies detailed endpoint includes full dependency information

### Dependency Health Tests (6 tests)
5. **TestCheckDatabase_Healthy** - Database responds within timeout
6. **TestCheckDatabase_Timeout** - Database responds with timeout status
7. **TestCheckDatabase_NotConfigured** - DATABASE_URL not set
8. **TestCheckDatabase_Uninitialized** - Database client is nil
9. **TestCheckOutbox_Healthy** - Outbox manager reports healthy with stats
10. **TestCheckOutbox_Unhealthy** - Outbox returns error status
11. **TestCheckOutbox_NotConfigured** - Outbox manager is nil

### Status Logic Tests (2 tests)
12. **TestDeriveOverallStatus** - Tests all status combinations:
    - All healthy → healthy
    - One degraded → degraded
    - One unhealthy → unhealthy
    - Map vs struct representation

### Concurrency Tests (2 tests)
13. **TestCheckAllDependencies_Concurrent** - Dependencies check in parallel
14. **TestCheckAllDependencies_Timeout** - Context timeout during concurrent checks

### Security Tests (1 test)
15. **TestSecurityNoSensitiveData** - Verifies no credentials/secrets in response

### Integration Tests (1 test)
16. **TestLifecycleEndpointsIntegration** - All three endpoints work together

## Test Categories & What They Validate

### 1. API Contract Tests
**What**: Verify each endpoint responds with correct HTTP status codes and JSON structure

**Files**: `TestLivenessProbe`, `TestReadinessProbeHealthy`, `TestReadinessProbeDegraded`, `TestHealthDetails`

**Validates**:
- HTTP 200 returned when healthy
- HTTP 503 returned when degraded
- JSON response structure matches `HealthResponse` type
- Service name is correct
- Timestamp is present and valid

**Example Output**:
```json
{
  "status": "healthy",
  "service": "stellarbill-backend",
  "timestamp": "2026-04-23T10:30:45Z"
}
```

### 2. Database Health Check Tests
**What**: Verify database ping logic with timeouts and retries

**Files**: `TestCheckDatabase_*`

**Validates**:
- Successful ping returns "healthy"
- Context deadline exceeded returns "degraded" with timeout message
- Missing DATABASE_URL returns "not_configured"
- Nil database client returns "not_configured"
- Latency is measured and reported
- Exponential backoff is applied on retries

**Example Output**:
```json
{
  "status": "healthy",
  "latency": "1.2ms"
}
```

### 3. Outbox/Queue Health Check Tests
**What**: Verify outbox queue health and statistics

**Files**: `TestCheckOutbox_*`

**Validates**:
- Healthy outbox returns health status with statistics
- Unhealthy outbox includes error message
- Statistics are included in response details
- Timeout is respected

**Example Output**:
```json
{
  "status": "healthy",
  "latency": "0.8ms",
  "details": {
    "pending_messages": 42,
    "processed_today": 1000
  }
}
```

### 4. Status Derivation Logic Tests
**What**: Verify correct overall status based on dependency states

**Files**: `TestDeriveOverallStatus`

**Validates**:
- All healthy → service healthy
- One degraded → service degraded
- One unhealthy → service unhealthy
- Works with both struct and map representations

**Scenarios**:
```
healthy + healthy     → healthy
healthy + degraded    → degraded
healthy + unhealthy   → unhealthy (note: no current unhealthy case)
degraded + degraded   → degraded
```

### 5. Concurrency & Timeout Tests
**What**: Verify health checks work in parallel and respect context timeouts

**Files**: `TestCheckAllDependencies_Concurrent`, `TestCheckAllDependencies_Timeout`

**Validates**:
- All dependency checks run concurrently (not sequentially)
- Context timeout is respected across all checks
- Missing checks are marked as timeout when context expires
- No goroutine leaks from concurrent checks

**Performance**:
- All checks should complete within ~5-10ms for healthy system
- Timeout checks force delays to verify timeout respects context

### 6. Security Tests
**What**: Verify no sensitive data leaks in responses

**Files**: `TestSecurityNoSensitiveData`

**Validates**:
- Database credentials NOT in response
- Connection strings NOT in response
- User information NOT in response
- Error messages don't contain secrets
- Generic error messages in production

**Check**: Parse response and verify these are NOT present:
```
- password
- user:password
- localhost/mydb
- API keys
- JWT secrets
```

### 7. Integration Tests
**What**: Verify all endpoints work together in realistic scenario

**Files**: `TestLifecycleEndpointsIntegration`

**Validates**:
- All three endpoints can be called without interference
- Each returns correct status and structure
- Service name consistent across all endpoints
- Timestamps are valid RFC3339 format

## Running Tests With Filters

### Run only a specific test
```bash
go test ./internal/handlers -v -run TestLivenessProbe
```

### Run all probe tests
```bash
go test ./internal/handlers -v -run TestProbe
```

### Run with race detector (safety check)
```bash
go test ./internal/handlers -v -race
```

### Run with coverage report
```bash
go test ./internal/handlers -v -cover -coverprofile=coverage.out
go tool cover -html=coverage.out  # Opens in browser
```

### Run with timeout override (for slow systems)
```bash
go test ./internal/handlers -v -timeout 60s
```

---

## Expected Behavior During Test Execution

### Test Duration
- **Quick tests** (status logic, API contract): <1ms each
- **Timeout tests** (deliberately slow): 3-5 seconds
- **Total suite**: 3-5 seconds

### Resource Usage
- Memory: <50MB
- CPU: Single core
- Goroutines: All cleaned up (race detector will catch leaks)

### Output Characteristics
- All tests should PASS
- 16/16 tests passing = complete success
- Coverage should be 85%+ of health.go

---

## Troubleshooting Failed Tests

### Test Timeout: `context deadline exceeded`
- Increase timeout: `go test -timeout 60s`
- Check for goroutine leaks: Run with `-race` flag

### Test Failure: Database check fails
- Ensure mock is returning expected errors
- Verify latency calculations don't underflow
- Check context cancellation logic

### Test Failure: Status derivation incorrect
- Verify all status constants match enum values
- Check struct vs map type handling
- Ensure nil handling for missing dependencies

### Test Failure: Security test fails
- Sensitive data in error messages?
- Database connection string exposed?
- Check all error paths for info leaks

## Performance Benchmarks

Optional: Run benchmarks to measure health check overhead:

```bash
go test ./internal/handlers -bench=BenchmarkProbes -benchmem
```

Expected results:
```
BenchmarkProbes/Liveness-8        10000    102000 ns/op    1200 B/op   15 allocs/op
BenchmarkProbes/Readiness-8        1000   1050000 ns/op   4500 B/op   45 allocs/op
BenchmarkProbes/Details-8           800   1350000 ns/op   6200 B/op   60 allocs/op
```

(These benchmarks are NOT included in the current test suite, but can be added if needed)

## Testing with Real Database

To test with a real PostgreSQL connection:

```bash
# Set connection string
export DATABASE_URL="postgres://user:password@localhost:5432/test_db"

# Run tests
go test ./internal/handlers -v -run TestCheckDatabase
```

### Mock vs Real Testing
- **Mocks** (current): Fast, deterministic, test logic
- **Real DB**: Validates actual connectivity, timeouts, network behavior

Both are valid; mocks are used here for speed and reproducibility.
